GettingAndCleaningDataProject
=============================
This is the main project due at the end of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data.

Main Goal
=========

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Scripts Used:
===============

This project contains the following files:

run_analysis.R - this is the main script that obtains, manipulates and writes out the data used in this project
CodeBook.md    - this is the main codebook that contains detailed descriptions and labels for all the data in the tidy data set

run_analysis.R details
=======================

This script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
